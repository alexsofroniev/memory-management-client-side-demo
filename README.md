# Memory Management Demo

A complete implementation of real-time memory monitoring with AES-256-GCM encryption built with Vite + React. 

## Features

- Data is processed in chunks to prevent memory overload
- Uses actual cryptographic operations, not simulation
- 100,000 iterations for secure key generation
- Real-time tracking of browser memory usage
- Forces garbage collection when memory usage is high
- Adjustable chunk sizes for different scenarios
- Maintains user experience during long operations

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
